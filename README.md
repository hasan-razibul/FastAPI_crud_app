## FastAPI CRUD App


In this project I have used fastapi and sqlalchemy to build an API. The goal of this project is to show how to : 
- create a sqlite database
- use CRUD http requests

The database is a simple sqlite database that will have a table named *'Orders'*. Id for each order will be generated by the datatbase itself. There is another column in the table named *'status'*. 
By default, the status column will be populated with *'initialized'* as soon as new order is added to the database.

#### There are 5 possible http requests available in this project -
- get (read the whole database)
- get/search (find order by searching order_name)
- post (to create new order)
- put (to update existing order)
- delete (to delete an order)

There are appropriate responses for both successful and failed responses with http error
(e.g *"404 ID not found"* or *"Order already exists"*)

To run the project :
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ uvicorn main:app --reload 
```

We can call and test the API directly from the browser.
Go to this [link](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#automatic-docs) to see how to do that.
